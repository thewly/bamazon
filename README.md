BamazonCostomer.JS

Running "node bamazonCustomer.js" will trigger the table stored in the bamazon server to display in terminal.

Once the table is displayed, you will be asked which item from the list you would like to purchase. 

After you input an ID number & hit enter, you will be asked how many of that item you would like to buy.

Once you submit a number, & hit enter, that request is sent to the server, those items are deducted from inventory,
& the table will redisplay, with updated inventory, in terminal with the order total beneath the updated table.
